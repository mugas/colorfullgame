<h1>JS Vanilla Game</h1>

In this tutorial from [Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) I put in practice and learn many subjects about JS. 

It was one tutorial that since the beggining I wanted to do something with it and make it personal.

In this repository there is the tutorial, my version you can find it [here](https://github.com/mugas/Musicquiz).

I reinforce the skills in <em>DOM Manipulation</em> and <em>Loops</em> and <em>functions</em> and start learn and work more with <em>Arrays and iteration</em> and the <em> keyword <strong>this</strong></em>.
